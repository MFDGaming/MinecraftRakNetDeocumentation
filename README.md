| raknet address | 7                 | The first byte is the address version (practically always 4). The next 4 bytes are the 4 parts of the IP address and they are decoded by subtracting the part's value from -1 and adding 255 to the result ((-1 - part) + 255). This applies for each byte one by one. The next 2 bytes are the port. They are a big endian unsigned short. |
